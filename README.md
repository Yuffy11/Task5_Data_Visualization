The first dashboard shows a gender-based analysis which shows subtle differences in health metrics between female and male gender within the dataset. While the variations are relatively small, they provide insights that can be of significance in healthcare and medical research, and from the analysis, the following records obtained were:

##### Female Gender:

Cholesterol: On average, females in the dataset exhibit a cholesterol level of approximately 184.25 units.
Blood Pressure: The average blood pressure for females is measured at approximately 114.78 units.
Average Temperature: Females have an average body temperature of approximately 98.59°F.
Average Heart Rate: The average heart rate for females is approximately 79.37 beats per

##### Male Gender:

Cholesterol:The average cholesterol level for males is approximately 184.67 units.
Blood Pressure: The average blood pressure for males is approximately 114.72 units.
Average Temperature: Males have an average body temperature of approximately 98.60°F.
Average Heart Rate: The average heart rate for males is also approximately 79.37 beats.
Average Age: Male individuals, on average, have an age of approximately 26.02 years.
Average BMI: The average BMI for males is approximately 23.37 units.

The second dashboard shows the number of students by smoking and that of the students by blood type. However, The analysis for students smoking and those who don't includes the following; 

##### Students who smoke:
The analysis reveals that approximately 2,848 students within the dataset engage in smoking.
This constitutes approximately 20% of the student populatio. 

##### Students who don't smoke:
It is indicated that approximately 11,415 students do not smoke which constitutes 80% of the total student population.

Also, for the students by blood type, it is shown that among students, the student's blood type O constitutes 25%, as does blood type A, blood type AB, and blood type B.

The data indicates that there is no dominance of blood type among the students, as all blood types are equally represented at 25% each.

The last snapshot provides an overview of the distribution of students with and without diabete. Based on the result, It is  revealed that;

##### Students with Diabetes:
Number of Students: 1409
Percentage of Total Population: 10%

##### Students without Diabetes:
Number of Students: 12854
Percentage of Total Population: 90%

This data highlights the prevalence of diabetes among the student population, with 10% of students affected. This information can be crucial for healthcare providers to make informed decisions

### Conclusion:
In summary, the analysis of the student data has revealed significant insights. These insights encompass the prevalence of diabetes among students, the distribution of different blood type, the average values of students who smoke and those who do not, and the average height and weight values for both genders.

However, this analysis serves as valuable insights for guiding decisions in areas relating to the health and well-being of the student community. The insights can inform health decisions, educational programs, and policies aimed at enhancing the overall health and wellness of the student population.
